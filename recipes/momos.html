    <h2>About Momos</h2>
    <p>omos are a beloved dumpling dish originating from Tibet and Nepal, now popular across many Asian countries and beyond. These bite-sized parcels are typically made from thin dough wrappers filled with a variety of ingredients, such as minced meat (like chicken or pork), vegetables, or tofu, often mixed with spices and seasonings.
