    <h2>About Chaap Recipe</h2>
    <p>Chaap is a North Indian vegetarian dish known for its delectable flavors and unique texture. It is typically made from soy or wheat protein, which is marinated in a blend of spices, yogurt, and other seasonings to infuse it with rich flavors. This marinated protein is then grilled or fried, resulting in a meaty and satisfying texture that resembles kebabs. Chaap can be served as a snack, appetizer, or main course, often accompanied by various chutneys and garnished with fresh herbs. Loved by both vegetarians and meat-eaters for its savory taste and meat-like texture, chaap has become a popular dish in North Indian cuisine, showcasing the culinary diversity of the region.</p>
